## Summary

The paper explores how language models rely on spurious correlations, known as shortcuts, to make final decisions. It introduces a benchmark to categorize and test these shortcuts, finding that while some larger, deliberately designed models show partial resistance, none are entirely robust.

## Strengths

The paper provides valuable insights and a solid framework for measuring the effects of small nuances on the model's performance. Furthermore, the method is extensible and could be applied to other domains.

## Weaknesses

In my opinion, the main weakness of the paper is its exclusive focus on Sentiment Analysis task. Additionally, when examining the impact of author style, only the styles of two authors with old-fashioned writing were considered. It would be more interesting if the paper explored the writing styles of different age groups or individuals who speak English as a second language, as these styles are more commonly encountered in real-world data than those of Shakespeare and Hamilton.

## My insights for future works

I believe this paper can be extended in the following ways:
- Expanding the application of this method to domains beyond text.
- Proposing a more comprehensive approach by implementing an adversarial framework to detect unseen biases in large language models, where one model attempts to outsmart another on a given task.
