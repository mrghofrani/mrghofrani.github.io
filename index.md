Hello! I’m Mohammadreza Ghofrani, a graduate student with a Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence, specializing in Natural Language Processing, from Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic). During my master’s studies, I had the privilege of working under the guidance of Dr. MohammadMehdi Homayounpour[\*](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1PVbtE4AAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. Saeedeh Momtazi[\*\*](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=N-WqXykAAAAJ&hl=en), focusing on my thesis titled "Response Generation in Task-based Dialogue Systems with Limited Training Data."

Prior to my master's, I completed my bachelor’s degree under the supervision of Dr. Saeedeh Momtazi[\*\*](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=N-WqXykAAAAJ&hl=en), where I worked on "Implementing a Relation Extraction System for Persian Texts using Distant Supervision."

On the [blog](/blog/) section, I occasionally share my thoughts on the papers I read.

## Selected Projects

<br>
**CommonCrawl Language Specific Downloader** [github](https://github.com/mrghofrani/cc-downloader)
<br> This script downloads *only* the segments of the CommonCrawl dataset for the specified language. CommonCrawl archives and publishes internet content every few months, making it a valuable resource for extracting data to train language models (or large language models, as they are commonly known today).
